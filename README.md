The Custom theme was developed by using the bootstrap, php, html and it is integrated into the wordpress. 
In the css the designing of the customstyle is being used for the navigation bar and the blog is also added to get the required look to the displayed page in the website.
In the website all the content can be edited. The admin can post and also update the existing blog in the website. 
The details in the main page can also be edited as the options for editing the content is the main priority in building this website. 
Uploading new pictures is very easy as the user have to upload the images in the sliderand save it which will automaticallly change the images.
